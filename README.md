# Calorie Predictor Project

## :star: Project Overview
The **Calorie Predictor** is a machine learning model designed to predict daily calorie requirements based on personal information such as age, weight, height, gender, activity level, and meal frequency. This project uses regression models to provide accurate predictions that help individuals maintain a healthy lifestyle. The project also features a **Streamlit app** for easy use and interaction.

## :package: Installation Instructions

### Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, streamlit, joblib

### Steps to Install:

1. **Clone the repository (if hosted on GitHub):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calorie-predictor.git
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
:running: How to Run the Project
Download the Dataset:
Ensure you have the dataset (e.g., dataset.csv) for training the model. You can use the dataset provided in the project.

Data Preprocessing:
Run the preprocessing script to clean and handle missing values.

Train the Model:
Train your model using one of the regression algorithms like Random Forest, Linear Regression, etc.

Streamlit Interface:
After training the model, launch the Streamlit interface to input user details and make predictions.

:recycle: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
The following preprocessing steps were performed on the raw dataset:

Missing Value Handling:
Any missing values in the dataset were filled or removed based on the nature of the column.

Outlier Removal:
Outliers were detected and removed using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method to ensure that the model performs well and isn't affected by extreme values.

Feature Engineering:
Features such as gender, exercise level, meal frequency, etc., were encoded into numerical values for machine learning algorithms.

Normalization:
Some continuous variables (such as height, weight) were normalized to ensure they are on a similar scale.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: Data Visualizations
The following visualizations were used for data exploration and analysis:

1. Gender Distribution:
Graph: Count plot (sns.countplot())

Purpose: This graph helps us understand the distribution of male vs female in the dataset.

python

sns.countplot(x='Gender', data=combined_data)
2. Age Distribution:
Graph: Distribution plot (sns.distplot())

Purpose: To visualize the distribution of age across all data points.

python
Copy
Edit
sns.distplot(combined_data['Age'])
3. Height vs Weight Distribution:
Graph: Scatter plot (sns.scatterplot())

Purpose: Visualizes the relationship between height and weight.

python
Copy

sns.scatterplot(x='Height', y='Weight', data=combined_data)
4. Boxplot for Outliers (before and after removal):
Graph: Box plot (sns.boxplot())

Purpose: Detects and removes outliers in the dataset.

python

sns.boxplot(data=combined_data)
5. Correlation Heatmap:
Graph: Heatmap (sns.heatmap())

Purpose: Shows the correlation between different features.

python

sns.heatmap(combined_data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
:bar_chart: Model Training
We trained the following regression models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regression

Decision Tree Regression

Gradient Boosting

SVR (Support Vector Regressor)

We evaluated these models using R² (R-squared) score and selected the best-performing model based on the highest R² value.

:desktop_computer: Streamlit Interface
Once the model is trained, the Streamlit interface allows users to input their details (age, weight, height, activity level) and receive an estimated daily calorie requirement.

Features:
Inputs: Gender, Age, Weight, Height, Activity Level, Meal Frequency.

Prediction: Users can click a "Predict Calories" button to see their daily calorie requirement.

Interactive Design: Dropdowns, sliders, and buttons for an engaging experience.

:bar_chart: Explanations of Graphs
Gender Distribution: Shows how balanced the dataset is in terms of gender.

Age Distribution: Identifies the range of ages and the frequency of each group.

Height vs Weight: Helps us understand patterns or outliers in height and weight.

Outliers Identification: Box plots highlight outliers that may affect model accuracy.

Correlation Heatmap: Helps identify strongly correlated features, which are useful for predictions.

:trophy: Accuracy of the Models
Each model was evaluated using the R² (R-squared) score:

Random Forest Regressor: Best model with the highest R² score.

Decision Tree Regressor: Second-best with a good fit.

Other models had varying degrees of accuracy.

Conclusion: The Random Forest model provided the most reliable predictions.

:rocket: Conclusion
This project builds a machine learning model to predict daily calorie requirements based on personal information. The Streamlit app provides an easy interface for users to interact with the model and get personalized calorie predictions.
